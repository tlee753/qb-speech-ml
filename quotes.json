                "we've overcome a lot this year you know
                down but not out
                and we found a way to play our best last
                four games
                Buffalo Jets had to buy played great
                against chargers played really well
                today
                and we're gonna need one more great game
                so I was pretty a great way to end it I
                was probably as excited as I've been in
                a long time and you know a lot of things
                one play here one play there could
                change everything but that's football in
                just five of our team you know you're
                just part of part of playing sports and
                it's just you know staying in the moment
                and you know we always say one you know
                one play at a time you can't make up for
                things that happen in the past and he's
                got think about what you're gonna do
                moving forward and you just you know
                start the fourth quarter they scored you
                know we're up three to start the fourth
                quarter and I said I would you know what
                a great opportunity you know to be
                against this team to be ahead three in
                the fourth quarter chance to win you
                know it's pretty sweet and you know they
                blew so many teams out this year and
                it's just a great opportunity for us
                yeah it was good they have an explosive
                offense with Kelsey and Hill and Patrick
                the way he played and he played a great
                game you know you play on the road it's
                gonna be tough and you know what travels
                is run running the wall playing tough
                and that's good in any weather any
                condition any environment any stadium
                you know that was a big part of our game
                and Sony ran his butt off Rex ran his
                butt off and it's weren't too much the
                last 30 minutes so I'm going to try to
                cut back for a little bit but uh she's a
                great game
                I think you know when you got 70,
                000
                people cheering again it's pretty
                sweet when you went on the road and it's
                a hard thing to do in the NFL certain
                the hard thing to do against the first
                ranked team you know the conference
                who's been playing great all year and
                certainly played well at home so we knew
                it was gonna take a lot it obviously
                took into overtime it took some great
                plays and great conversions and just
                proud of us getting the job done yeah
                huge caught the fade on on Eric and then
                caught the slant and was playing his
                plans but off he's done that all year
                you know he's out there
                whatever we asked to do he does with you
                know enthusiasm about him he's an
                incredible teammate person the kind of
                guy he is I know everyone doesn't know
                him personally but he's just he's a
                great man
                and just so happy to been able to play
                with them for as long as we have it was
                just you know it was all you know is it
                was the odds were stacked against us and
                it hasn't been that way for us for
                awhile and it certainly was this year
                and yeah we started off so slow and like
                I said the last four games have been our
                best games we ran it great in Buffalo we
                threw it pretty good in the Jets really
                balanced defense playing really well
                played great against charges last week
                and then you know this is a game
                offensively we did a good job you know
                we had a couple little screw-ups but
                pretty good for the most part and then
                you know defensively they they hung on
                and played their butts off you know shut
                him out in the first half which was
                pretty spectacular and you're not gonna
                shut this team out you know for four
                quarters you know certainly not at home
                and there's a great team win
                yeah these are these are memories you
                know that'll last a lifetime and I've
                just I said a few weeks ago I'm just I'm
                blessed to find something that I'd love
                to do that I'd love to work at and
                that's probably been the biggest
                blessing of my life I love you know
                working hard at trying to make
                improvements and every year we started a
                different place and uh you know I love
                the grind of it you know being in the
                moment and you know this was just
                incredible a little both you know I
                think the scheme helped but I think the
                route running and the catching was
                incredible you know they were you know
                making the toughest catches in the
                middle of field Julian was got hammered
                on the one maybe there was two of them
                hoax made an incredible catch in the
                fourth quarter there I mean it took
                everything so it was a just a great
                great team win
                yeah yeah bundled up yeah you know we
                love you guys
                thanks for the incredible support all
                season you know we played great at home
                and it was nice to go on the road and
                you know just a spectacular win
                hopefully the fans enjoy I talked to my
                wife talked to my kids talk to my
                parents they're all I had heart attacks
                almost and that's what these games come
                down to so I mean they're great team I
                mean I haven't studied them for for one
                second all year so I mean we'll get to
                work on them tomorrow and to get to this
                point is extremely difficult
                you know they've faced some challenges
                they've got a great team great running
                back great offense you know great
                defense so well coached it's gonna be a
                great game
                so thank you guys appreciate it"

                "yeah they challenged us they came up
                play man not a lot of teams have this
                year and they put people in our face and
                they see how we see how we responded in
                the first half we struggled we couldn't
                make anything happen but then the second
                half I got flogger guys took the
                challenge and they were doing the same
                things and we were just winning and you
                have to do that you have to find ways to
                win against one-on-one matchups and we
                we found ways in the second half yeah I
                mean I've ultimate trust in the defense
                I mean I I know those guys are out there
                giving everything they have one of those
                guys are doing whatever they can and
                they just they ended up making more
                plays than we did in the end but at the
                same time I had to trust that we're
                gonna get to stop and if we got the
                chance I felt we were going to score
                yeah I mean we knew we had it I get info
                phone rings off we had good pretty good
                return to get us in a short shorter yard
                yardage where we didn't have to get too
                much and we knew if we get it in a
                Harrisons of wrench he's gonna make it
                and so we we found ways to get a couple
                plays there and then he knocked in
                yeah I mean first of all I mean every
                team's gonna be different year the year
                but same time we have a lot of young
                guys on this team and I mean it hurts it
                hurts everybody we knew we had the
                opportunities this game and this season
                and we put in the work but uh we know
                that this can this can be a building
                block it could be something that carries
                us in the future I mean right now it's
                the end but hopefully it's just the
                beginning of a long time I mean you have
                you have to take in the hurt I mean you
                have to be accept accept that I mean
                this hurts I mean it's supposed to hurt
                you put in work for this you you're
                doing everything you can to get to the
                Super Bowl and to win it and for the
                this opportunity to fall short I mean
                it's gonna hurt and he told us to accept
                that I mean you have to go through that
                but at the same time when you when you
                look back and then you come back and
                look at the bigger picture you know that
                you can build off this use this feeling
                as motivation to go out and find ways to
                win next time
                yeah I mean you just stay within the
                game plan you can't try to do too much
                they had a good game plan came out came
                out fast and so we we we started slow
                but we picked it up and you've got trust
                in the process not try to do too much
                and things will start happening and
                having success your way the coin tosses
                I guess you'd say I mean it's the thing
                where he had a great Drive had a lot of
                third down conversions and big moments
                guys made big catches for them but it's
                the thing where you all you can do is
                support your teammates trust in your
                teammates and then when you get your
                opportunity you go out there and try to
                make place I think we just met we manned
                up there was nothing different they play
                the same coverages we did the same
                things guys just made place that was
                that was the message in halftime by
                everybody was which is man up go out
                there and make plays against this man
                and and see what happens from there
                no doubt at all but I mean you can't
                that's just like if somebody I mean you
                can you can't look at that about the
                same time I fell we were rolling but I
                mean it didn't go our way and we we knew
                with the situation that we need the
                touchdown the play coach you told me
                before the play touchdown or get the
                ball in my hands and you throw it away
                and we had a good play call on but they
                had enough guys in the endzone that I
                didn't want to force it in there and a
                four pick and so I just found a way to
                throw it out of bounds where we wouldn't
                attentional grounding or anything like
                that and but Kentucky didn't I mean just
                just not starting how we wanted to start
                sweet we at least which were left like
                31 points in the second half both games
                we played them and so he's got to find a
                way to start better it's something I
                look back on my entire career and then
                use it as something that I can find ways
                to win these games whenever I'm in them
                [Music
            ]
                yeah I mean we'll be together I mean
                we're great friends we have great
                relationships so we'll get into work and
                kinda like you said I mean it's not
                always the same team but there's a lot
                of the same core guys that will be here
                next year and hopefully a lot of a lot
                of the whole team and so for us we're
                gonna keep that chemistry going get
                better in every single way that we can
                look back on the film and see what we
                didn't do as well and see what we did
                well and try to try to really emphasize
                that stuff and then that's that stuff
                you have to do in order to be a great
                team and keep this success going 95% of
                the plays he made the one play with the
                deep one but I mean you guys have to
                step up and I thought guys did when we
                put points on the board we found ways to
                move the ball whenever we needed to and
                so that just comes with how we played
                all season that you whoever gets their
                opportunity they're out there making
                place"

                "anyone feels great it's hard to do you
                know having success at this level is
                hard to do but the best part about it
                was that we were here at home you know
                you got to feel the energy of the crowd
                how badly they wanted it as well you
                know we got a play for play for each
                other but at the same time this city
                does deserve it we got to have that
                mindset of going to get it no matter
                what's happening so I felt great
                treated like any other time gotta go do
                my job you know don't overthink it you
                know live in the moment it's at that
                time I got to command the offense to got
                to command the team you know got to
                bring a spark and give us a chance to
                win that's my job and so that was what I
                was focused on uh for everybody else to
                see around here you know I feel like
                it's people have been talking about it
                for a while but I've just been waiting
                for my moment and patient you know I've
                been in a good opportunity put in a good
                situation with guys around me veteran
                cubies and great coaches that I can
                learn from you know it was never whining
                or complaining about playing time just
                you know want the team to win and no
                matter what the cost is we had a whole
                half to play and some change in that
                second quarter so you know just wanted
                to chip away and all points are good
                points at that point you know you got a
                kind of battle back got a chip away and
                so there was a sense of urgency
                absolutely of me and the aggressive team
                you know putting them on their heels but
                at the same time we weren't trying to
                push too hard
                ya know anytime you can get the crowd to
                be a factor kudos to the crowd I played
                a big factor late in the game and so
                anytime you can get them to you know be
                your 12th man as cliche as that sounds
                it's the truth so whatever we have to do
                to fire them up to affect the other
                offense that's great
                it's definitely up there being the first
                NFL game I've played in first regular
                season one that actually counts so it's
                definitely up there for me I've had some
                great memories but you know I'm just
                just getting started just being ready to
                go
                I think being decisive of where I want
                to put the ball I think you know just
                attacking like I said you want to put
                them on their heels and so when you do
                that often builds confidence the offense
                will see that they'll start to build
                confidence as well then like we said the
                crowd gets into it you know when you get
                all three phases like that going it's
                pretty tough to stop seeing things
                eliminating quickly and just trusting
                you guys to be in the spots they're
                supposed to be in Oh anytime you're not
                having success there's no reason to
                celebrate a bad play or when you're not
                having success you want to have success
                that's talked about it it's football is
                hard to have success it's tough to do
                your job
                that was the first to you good no not
                right off the bat I was never trying to
                put too much on my shoulders just trying
                to do my job get the ball out in their
                hands you know when you can do that
                they're gonna make place for you these
                guys are the best in the world of what
                they do and so that's what my mindset
                you know that's where I was at but at
                the same time before I was even in that
                my job was to be there for the team and
                help in any way we can to win
                and so just coaching guys up on
                different looks and being that extra guy
                when coaches aren't there or ties
                watching tape or looking at different
                you know defensive fronts and coverage
                is so much we all have a job here and so
                tonight we did a good job and pulled out
                a win daily deleted the Cleveland fans
                that's you know comes with it but it's
                it's not the only win we're gonna
                celebrate you know it's it's a building
                block for us did some good things but
                there's still a lot we can work on and
                that's the great part about it we're
                nowhere near where we want to be but
                we're in a good spot right now to you
                know build a foundation and keep going a
                little bit you know pretty hectic right
                there after the game told him good game
                keep playing well you know keep pushing
                we're in the same spot
                rookies playing our first NFL games so
                he's playing well he's leading his team
                so I'm proud of him know it's never
                about up you know playing one person
                it's about getting the team win focused
                on that you know singular focus gonna
                enjoy this one
                it's
                coccioli said it's like winning twice
                you play on Thursday and then you get to
                watch everybody else lose on on Sunday
                so you enjoy it right now and then we'll
                see what happens next week but that's
                the mindset you have to have you have to
                hit the reset button as soon as this
                weekend's over and we're back to work
                that's all that matters
                I think that's how the play was drawn up
                we knew we were gonna call it that I was
                the first read so I was hoping he was
                gonna throw it to me not in the right
                spot Tony
                never taking a rep of it but watching
                tied to it all through practice it's not
                too hard to call out of cadence and walk
                up to the line and kind of just stand
                there the result of wind yes that's the
                way I've always wanted it but you know
                the circumstances of what I was going in
                with never want to go in after one of
                your captain gets hurt
                so that's you never want that but the
                result was what we wanted and so what's
                the tape think about it is you're never
                as good is how it feels after the game
                and it's never as bad so I'll be excited
                to get the tape and you know see what we
                can build on
                yeah for starters the first game ball he
                gave was the Haslam family and so he
                talked about you know they've stuck with
                him through thick and thin and it's been
                tough for him so it meant a lot you know
                he's had a lot of pressure on in him and
                he's put a lot of them his shoulders you
                know and what we need to realize as a
                franchise now it's everybody has their
                job to do it's not all in one person
                it's not all on me right now it's it's
                everybody
                you have your 111th on offense and you
                know I can say that about special teams
                and defense as well you know we got to
                work each day to have success and that's
                just the way it goes to what oh no I
                have not had a chance yet
                just do your job not gonna try and
                overdo it just gonna be myself lead play
                with fire and passion I've always been
                like that I've always been a guy to keep
                the positive energy on the sideline
                always you know the most important
                player next one no matter what happens
                and even before the game getting guys in
                the right mindset confident you play
                well when it you're confident you know
                people can say cockiness whatever but
                it's there's results when you play with
                the confidence and you believe in
                yourself and so that's what I always try
                and do with my guys that's what I've
                always done and you know I just try to
                carry that over when I was in that might
                have been it
                so leaving deserves a win but we're not
                done yet
                so don't break the dilly dilly coolers
                too hard just enjoy it we deserve it but
                at the same time we're just getting
                started
                and Christian Yelich for NL MVP

                "well there's no question this is this is
                a sweet day this was a sweet victory to
                me this victory sort of is a great
                example of what this entire season has
                been like it's it hasn't been easy it's
                been a lot of different people stepping
                up doing their parts at different times
                starters non-starters becoming starters
                and you know you know our both our
                safeties get hurt today and we got some
                guys go in there and step up and help us
                get that win so it's been a unique
                season there's no question about it and
                this game today was a unique football
                game but everybody did their part truly
                was a team win hey you guys struck a
                little bit running the ball today did
                you think it was going to take you to
                take it I don't think I got us out of it
                but we knew he was going to be a
                challenge running the ball they have an
                excellent front they've got some stout
                guys up there but we felt like we had to
                stay committed to it just to try to
                create some balance and not become one
                dementia where we were throwing every
                time that's we played these guys last
                year and that's what happened we got
                behind we do it every time and they can
                force you to do that and that's not a
                good recipe for having a chance to beat
                those guys and so keeps keeping some
                kind of balance whether you were
                productive or not thought that was
                important in the running game hey Peyton
                can you talk about the run no
                specifically is is that a play you would
                have made last years there's something
                different about how you're seeing things
                this year what's that on that Oh the run
                the 12 yard run that led to you know it
                was they dropped a lot of guys in
                coverage and we were we sent five guys
                out we were trying to try to find a hole
                in there either on the front side of the
                backside and they had it covered covered
                well obviously the first down we wanted
                it to lead to points but one thing it
                did do is change field position and
                Cokely was also
                kayvon was awesome down and those punch
                down inside the 4 yard line so we have
                two possessions in a row where we didn't
                get points but we changed field position
                and it was that kind of game in the
                second half obviously a lot of people
                suggest it could be the last time you
                and Tom Brady made if that is the case
                how special is both his friendship and
                rivalry baby yeah it's I'm not gonna get
                into what-if scenarios but I've stated
                at all we have stated that my entire
                career I have great respect you know for
                Tom as a as a player as a friend and for
                the job he's done there's a quarterback
                for that franchise and then you know for
                coach Belichick I mean I think this was
                my seventh time playing against the
                Patriots when Tom Brady was a
                quarterback I think it's about the 24th
                time I played against Bill Belichick as
                the defensive coordinator or the head
                coach so I can't get away from either of
                those guys and just like today it's
                always been a tremendous challenge when
                you play against both of them together
                especially but my hat's off to their
                entire team you know Collins and it was
                awesome McCourt it was awesome all those
                guys on defense really really played
                well today I thought Payton given where
                you were physically in the middle of
                November if somebody told you then that
                you were gonna have this moment going
                back to the Superbowl as a starting
                quarterback what would you have thought
                or said oh it's hard to say I really
                tried to take it take it one week at a
                time all season long you know through my
                injuries and some of the other things
                that have gone on just kind of staying
                in the moment taking it one week at a
                time not assuming that hey this is how
                it's going to be this is a final final
                decision here one way or the other so
                try to take it one with your time stay
                patient and I think that served me well
                and you know I think that staying
                patient in these past two playoff games
                has served our team well also and has
                definitely served me well hey Peyton
                just kind of following up on that theme
                when you think about the time you were
                off with the layoff and and whether or
                not mentally there was a test of your
                patience can you reflect on that
                now that it's that you've gotten to this
                point what does it mean I mean not
                really it's not really time to reflect
                it's two we have two weeks to play we're
                gonna play a team that we are completely
                unfamiliar with there's gonna be a lot
                of film to study so I think once again
                just just trying to kind of stay in the
                moment we'll enjoy this this victory
                tonight this was a special victory as a
                heck of a game but I think kind of like
                I was saying earlier just sort of taking
                it one week at a time and staying
                patient that's kind of been the advice
                that I've tried to follow and I think
                that's served me well so far"

                "I guess did you miss me I think the most
                important thing is being back in the

                weapons that we have outside when you
                add intense the hardest-working and our
                building is the offensive line and when
                they're protecting the way that they are
                you you got you you can do nothing else

                every practice I catered meals to my my
                teammates just so I could have that you
                know that that team bonding that I
                missed here so I feel like I we had a
                pretty good plan to go yeah you know it
                was it was very exciting man I love
                those guys and I owe everything to them
                because they helped me prepare and even
                you know boosted their confidence a
                little bit get a chance to work in an
                NFL system and go out there compete
                against each other it was practically
                like a little mini camp you know we had
                it over there a Skyway and did a little
                at usf I mean it was very exciting
                I mean I've learned from fish ever since
                he's been here you know but as a team
                we're playing very well I wanted to be a
                part of that and now I'm a part of that
                so now is it's gonna be great it's gonna
                be fun well well this happened two and
                half years ago and over the course of me
                being a franchise quarterback here or
                supposed a franchise quarterback I've
                learned a lot you know I love this
                community I do all I can to help prosper
                make this community prosper with going
                building dream dream rooms going to
                different community events getting
                around my teammates and and I've been
                working hard ever since I stepped foot
                in this building
                well yeah I got a little bit look at
                that last year when I was injured you
                know anytime you're away from the
                building
                you have a different perspective but
                definitely I think I hit on network was
                spending quality time with my family my
                three 3-month year olds three month old
                son this Saturday has definitely changed
                the perspective of my life that football
                can't really uh can't do I think you
                know I'm at home you know sometimes you
                don't want to hear the people in your
                house so I got to get to like a place by
                myself you know because I'm all in it
                but it's a sign man like we're having a
                lot of success and and I want that to
                continue and I know it will so me being
                back
                I mean it's nothing's changing you know
                I'm just happy that I can be a part of
                it I'm happy that when we have a win I
                can come off and you know DAP guys up
                and and celebrate with them you know I
                think that's tough that's the part that
                you miss that team bonding you know
                because we do this together and it's
                tough going out there game wins I mean I
                seen the beers you know but when a guy
                throws for 400 yards three games in a
                row you know you gotta love that and as
                a community we got to get behind this
                team you know because we're when we're
                winning when things are going good we
                got to capitalize on capitalize on that
                and I'm just happy to be back man like
                I'm happy that now I can be a part of
                that I'm not watching from a distance
                man I can I can be here with my team
                about the team success you know I'm not
                I'm not a selfish player it's about our
                team we're out here doing big things and
                we got to continue doing that
                that's just that's just passion for the
                game you know again this guy's been
                playing for 14 years you know he loves
                going out there and competing and doing
                this thing well I'm grateful for the
                opportunity I get to play football
                thanks a privilege to different playing
                this in this football league but saying
                time it makes it so much easier when we

                part of that so right now I'm just
                focused on moving forward and now I get
                a chance to be a part of that and you
